# N04H-bot by Noah Segal-Gould
I adapted [Trump Tweets](https://github.com/sashaperigo/Trump-Tweets) to download what I could of my own tweets and then adapted [Deep Cyber](https://github.com/armbues/deep_cyber) to train an LSTM on them.

Written for Python 3.

### Future Goals
* Clean up the code. Right now **It Just Worksâ„¢**.
* Handle unicode properly? How can I to make it Tweet emoji?
* Train the model better and for longer? I did 44,000 iterations for the current bot.
